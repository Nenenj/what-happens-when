# What Happens When Typing "https://www.google.com" in a Browser?

When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter, several things happen behind the scenes:

- **DNS Resolution**: The browser sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.
- **TCP/IP Connection**: The browser establishes a TCP connection with the server hosting Google's website.
- **Encryption**: HTTPS encryption ensures secure communication between the browser and the server.
- **Firewall**: The request may pass through a firewall, which filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.
- **Load Balancing**: If Google employs load balancers, the request is distributed among multiple servers for optimal performance.
- **Web Server**: A web server receives the request, processes it, and serves the requested web page.
- **Application Server**: In case of dynamic content, an application server may generate the web page.
- **Database Interaction**: The application server may interact with a database to fetch or update data.
